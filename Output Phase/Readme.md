# Project Output Screenshot

This folder contains the final screenshot demonstrating the successful completion of the "Laptop Request Catalog Item" project.

## What This Image Shows

The screenshot shows the **"Order Status"** page within the ServiceNow Service Portal. This is the screen the end-user sees immediately after they submit the laptop request form.

Key things to note in the image:

* **Confirmation Message:** "Thank you, your request has been submitted."
* **Request Number:** A unique Request Number (e.g., `REQ0010002`) has been generated, proving the record was created in the database.
* **Stage Tracker:** The workflow "Stage" is active, showing the user where their request is in the fulfillment process.

This image serves as visual confirmation that the Service Catalog Item is functioning correctly from an end-user's perspective.
